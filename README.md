# mod-3-guide-7-dom
This project was made with Javascript, CSS and HTML.
I but most everything into a class so that I could style it in the CSS file. 
I did not want to have everything with in the HTML doc (<style> and <script>).
I feel that it is better orginized this way.
I but an animation and functiong on the image, with a button.
So that when you click the button the clip slowly appears and becomes larger.
I but a hover effect on all the buttons and a click me function with a dom element, so that when you click the pruple buttons the get replaced with a text.
